# Structural Design Patterns

This folder contains assignments for **Structural Design Patterns**.

Structural patterns are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures. They help ensure that when one part of a system changes, the entire structure doesn't need to change.

## Patterns

(Patterns will be added here)

## Examples of Structural Patterns

- **Adapter Pattern**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together
- **Bridge Pattern**: Separates abstraction from implementation
- **Composite Pattern**: Composes objects into tree structures
- **Decorator Pattern**: Adds behavior to objects dynamically
- **Facade Pattern**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem
- **Flyweight Pattern**: Minimizes memory usage by sharing data
- **Proxy Pattern**: Provides a placeholder for another object

## Structure

Each pattern folder will follow this structure:

```
pattern-name/
├── problem/          # Assignment code with design issues
│   ├── ASSIGNMENT.md
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── pom.xml
│   └── src/
└── solution/         # Refactored solution
    ├── README.md
    ├── pom.xml
    └── src/
```
